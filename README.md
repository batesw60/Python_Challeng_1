# Python_Challeng_1 Food Truck Order


This program simulates a food truck ordering system. It displays main category information such as meal drinks, etc. From there you then produce a menu where the item and item price are set where the user can select what they wish to order. Once they select what they want to order users can then select how many of those items they wish to order. Once they do that we ask if they want to keep ordering. This allows the user to select as many items as they would like.

Once they finish, we output a table with the name of each item ordered, the price for one of those items and the quantity of those items they ordered. The final output is the total price due.
